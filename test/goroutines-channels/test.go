new(int)        -->  NEW(*int)
new(Point)      -->  NEW(*Point)
new(chan int)   -->  NEW(*chan int)
make([]int, 10) -->  NEW([]int, 10)

make(Point)  // Illegal
make(int)    // Illegal


Things you can do with make that you can't do any other way:

  . Create a channel
  . Create a map with space preallocated
  . Create a slice with space preallocated or with len != cap


"make" function allocates and initializes an object of type slice, map, or chan only.
Like new, the first argument is a type. But, it can also take a second argument,
the size. Unlike new, makeâ€™s return type is the same as the type of its argument,
not a pointer to it. And the allocated value is initialized (not set to zero
value like in new). The reason is that:

 slice, map and chan are data structures.


They need to be initialized, otherwise they won't be usable. This is the reason
new() and make() need to be different.
